note: Regarding the first candidate selection process.
message: Use gemini to build some profiles of individual that have generically attributable means.

First, create a search agent that will extract all the classes in that file.
.. These classes are used to filter explicit events from the content data.
.. Using those events as baseline, we will construct a set of criterion functionals so that candidate agents can be evaluated with those to ensure compatibility across the whole spectrum.
.. Also we will need to have the whole spectrum covering the possible agents who would represent each of the discovered instances.

Second, use another search agent to look for non-repeating data points for each of the baseline parameters.
.. This agent will produce different permutations of the class instances present in that data.
