continuation of [step] for description model:
  .. we need a program called channel
  .. channel could be composed to build other channels
  .. let any collection of channels be called Mixer

[Mixer]:
  .. a set of channels that connect to produce new channel
  .. a mixer output is a channel that produce main output
  .. main output contains (left, right) tracks

let channel be an ordered collection of at least two input sources and call it Channel:
.. any input source is called Track
.. any collection of tracks are ordered set
.. channel defines how data flow from sources into state substrate
[state]
  .. tensor of shape (2 x number of source)
  .. requires a substrate (tensor) that defines propagation laws
.. state is transformed via some laws
.. channel produces sink of shape (number of frames x 2)
.. sink can be any file path or memory path

next step:
.. design the substrate and container
.. create tests for container, channel, mixer, track, propagation
.. go to [propagation]
