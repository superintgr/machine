it is twice as efficient if two people are each addressing each others' problem

what is needed:
.. a third person
.. it must oversee both repository
.. it must attend them regularly
.. regularity is scheduled via quarterly filling

a meeting room needed too:
.. room runs year-wide
.. schedule is instantiated with run cycles

what is required:
.. start three seperate processes
.. run them redundantly over periods
.. balance schedule and optimize workload

tracking:
.. stereo of shape (3 x 192000 x units per 360 days)

mixing:
.. runs with three channels sent in
.. compiles with two channels sent out

master:
.. follows scheduled mix programs
.. all input channels are routed into the board
.. board provides monitoring outs to generators
.. master is produced with main outputs
.. output tracks are saved

programming:
.. restore session
.. sample main
.. compute transform
.. update instrumentation
