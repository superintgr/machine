any system can hold information (if)
. it has some state which can store information
.. it has another set of states that can also store information
... the union of the two states cannot hold information, because no physical process can distinguish between those states.

any system is an information medium if it can store and/or process information (while)
... its states can contain some observable
.. observables are physically distinguishable
. measurement of the variables can yield observable attributes.

(when) a system is an information media
. any one of its possible observables can be used to compute measurable states
.. computation requires one of the computation variable to be also an information variable
... at least two of the computation substrates differentiable states can be permuted.
