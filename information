system with two or more states:
.. each state can hold information with respect to the counterfactual of the other state
.. at any given state, one state is permuted into another and the union of two cannot hold information
.. for information to be available for storage, the system must be a medium where cloning information variable is possible
.. any information media is such when provided in the information state it transforms some other resource into a copy of the state
.. from the computation state, the permutation on the state that can be in at least one other distinguishable state of the same substrate encodes counterfactual knowledge
.. using counterfactual knowledge, the system can distinguish between two possible information observables where one is the computation variable
.. the computation medium is defined with those set of variable where at least one of them is also a computation variable

for cloning purpose:
.. generic substrates could be build from naturally occuring resources
.. although there might be side-effect, nevertheless creating a copy of the information observables using those samples is possible
.. the system is an information media when it produces two copy of the same variable given the variable along with resource sampler
.. resource sampler transforms some quantity from its environment into knowledge about the counterfactual states, hence encode necessary observable property
.. finally any such media must remain viable through subsequent transformation tasks.
