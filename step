continuation of [constructor] process:
.. measure instrumentation via master output
.. load rendered output into memory
.. [assertions]
..   .. criterion for testability exists
.. use criterion on the basis

Quantum:
. Prompt is said by user
. user had said Prompt

For all Agent that generates completion for prompt on User:
. User and Agent are in superposition
. prompt and completion are in superposition

. qubits are (User, Agent, prompt, completion)
