# machine

```
Machine template with [N]umbers: 
  .. group of ordered objects
  .. known set
  .. {cyclic group} of order (N)
  [static]
    .. elements: member variable set
    .. operation: algebraic description
  .. the named constitution under definition
  [dynamic]
    .. take proposed group to build graph
    .. node represents each element
    .. antinode represents connecting function
    .. every computation should produce anti-computation or information where information then helps knowledge of the whole to arrive at the next position
    [state]
      .. represents connection patterns
      .. (changes) that is applied
      .. (errors) that is found
