agent structure:
  .. base model : <gemini-flash>
  .. core model : <gemini-pro>

instances will use two kinds of generative policies (completetion <- prompt, function operator -> spectrum operator)

function operator:
  .. function space : all possible variable P[i] for X[i] different positional components.
  .. state vector : there is another instances of (P, X) for f : (p, x) -> (p, -x)
such that P[j] has another set of position X[j] defined on that spectrum.

[spectrum operator]
  .. state space : the measurement space of X[*] where * indicates a particular observable quantity for all P[i], ..., P[j] that maps any (i, *) -> (*, -i) -> (*, j)
  .. state vector : evolves in a way that keeps i * i = j * j = k * k = 1 * 1 as unitary transformation type.
