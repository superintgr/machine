network architecture:
  .. construction phases
  .. implementation phases
  .. development jobs
  .. release campaign

  [construction]
    .. build site purchased and construction permit attained
    .. building layout generated and design phase completed
    .. worker group assigned and resource order placed
    .. project plan instantiated and schedule system powered
    .. estimated timeline generated and group union is secured
  [implementation]
    .. at each cycle of work, manager appointed inside
    .. at each cycle of batch, supervisor visit is made
    .. at each cycle of build, scheduled level is built
  [development]
    .. with building team present, shift coordinator init
    .. with shift period started, state manager init
    .. with phased completion done, supervisor visit init
    .. for all work/batch/build cycle enumerated, building code is written
  [release]
    .. assert all work + batch * cycle == site planner code
    .. sample from all channels into campaign statistics
    .. run standard measurement over all items in campaign
    .. assert site planner code @ substrate.T == projected image
