While left eye sees thing that is not in the field of right eye, what side must contained in that view?
For any change, there must be change across at least one of the side detected last, then from what is seen now all the unseen must effect those from before.
Have parallel channels given to each direction where their sides respectively captures the directionality along that pathway only.
For every update, update the components across all effected cross-sections when mixed into a stereo pair of states.

If all independent channels can be effected by their master product, then should their channel effect the devices that measures or represents the variables?
