continuation of [github.py] from individual and README.md:
  .. pending task include SSH business
  [SSH]
    .. go to key and come back
  .. preparing a generic machine requires fundamental course
  [fundamental]
    .. clone github repository at given public address
    .. install dependencies using requirement file
    .. use that repository content to process generic transformation tasks
    [generic]
      .. creating public-private keys
      .. using standard github tools
      .. managing system resource from os provided API
      .. search in local volume
      .. creating local message passing server (listener-server)
      .. running commands from python interpret window
      .. generating templates for ADSR family
      [ADSR]
        .. family manages an attack-sustain and decay-release phased structures
        .. attack : starter program that prepares a new cycle
        .. sustain : intermediate program that manages run/time and run/length phases
        .. decay : closure program that drives the execution from active through passive states
        .. release : exit and return programming of ongoing computation cycles ~ information phases

        next step:
          .. go to [/adsr] and come back
  .. pending task include system builder code from generic objects
  .. pensing task include main program description

next step:
  .. since this document is very long, we need a quick list outlining fast programming tasks
  .. before going to main.py, look into premain through [\adsr]
  .. go to main.py
