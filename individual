continues from [propagation] for defining tasks
.. create an object called Individual
.. individual requires an identity
.. identity could be generically sampled
[individual]
  .. given an identity, construct an equal length buffer register
  .. call it memory
  .. create a variable for storing only the object addresses
  .. assign each ordered buffer volume to the new variable of type list
  .. create a process (method) called associate
  [association]
    .. iterate over all items is memory
    .. for each memory amplitude data, swap the places in memory with places in the new variable which is a list
    .. return True at the end of entire loop
    .. break out
[action]
  .. groups, actions, structures, symmetries
  .. senses, sizes, complexes of types
  .. points, permutations, conservations, preserved quantities
  [substrate]
    .. go to [substrate]
