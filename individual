continues from [propagation] for defining tasks
.. create an object called Individual
.. individual requires an identity
.. identity could be generically sampled
[individual]
  .. given an identity, construct an equal length buffer register
  .. call it memory
  .. create a variable for storing only the object addresses
  .. assign each ordered buffer volume to the new variable of type list
  .. create a process (method) called associate
  [association]
    .. iterate over all items is memory
    .. for each memory amplitude data, swap the places in memory with places in the new variable which is a list
    .. return True at the end of entire loop
    .. break out
[action]
  .. groups, actions, structures, symmetries
  .. senses, sizes, complexes of types
  .. points, permutations, conservations, preserved quantities
  [substrate]
    .. go to [/substrate]
[group]
  .. arriving from partial [\substrate] on individual
  .. what are all the groups up to isomorphism?
  [information]
    .. for every states of that substrate, the union of all those with their effective action defines information being present
    .. the computation is when half of the permutated space can produce stability
    .. stability is when isomorphic
    .. knowledge define the other half from symmetry
    next step:
      .. go to [/substrate]
