continuation of [qubit]
.. define how signal must flow in a medium
.. we call it propagation law for that qubit
.. laws are described using matrices

[container]
  .. fixed shape
  .. positions are occupied
  .. occupied spaces contain rights
  [right]
    .. rights are not transferrible
    .. rights can compose into left/right
    .. rights can produce scaled rights only
  .. individual purchases the right

  [left]
    .. it is a position
    .. that position is allocated
    .. allocation required memory
    .. memory needs association
    .. association is defined in terms of two distinct positions
    .. association is physical information

[next step]
  .. write program for seeking association
  .. new data arrives at valid positions
  .. write program for generating rights
  .. new rights are responsibilities of an individual
  .. define transfer program as shift
  .. write process for transferring right positions
  .. go to [individual]
